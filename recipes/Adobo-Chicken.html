        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            My Filipino Mom taught me how to make this traditional dish following the recipe her mother taught her. 
            And though I've made a couple of changes, I guarantee they're Mom-approved. 'Lolah' is 'Grandma' in the Philippines, in case you were wondering.
            Serve over steamed rice.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, rinsed and patted dry</li>
            <Li>6 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced</Li>
            <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pickling spice, wrapped in cheesecloth</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until oil is shimmering. 
                Cook garlic in oil for no more than 30 seconds. Add all of the chicken to the pot; cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is white all over. 
                Do not brown.</li>
            
            <li>Pour in soy sauce, vinegar, and water, and add the pickling spice. 
                Make sure the spice ball is submerged. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and place lid on pot so that some steam can escape. 
                Simmer for 1 hour, or until chicken is very tender.</li>                             
        </ol>
